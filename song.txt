They say we are what we are,
But we don't have to be,
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way,
I'll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame,
I'll be the guard dog of all your favorite dreams,
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
(Ooh)
I try to picture me without you but I can't
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long,
And live with me forever now,
You pull the blackout curtains down,
Just not for long, for long,
We could be immor- immortals,
Immor- immortals,
Immor- immortals,
Immor- immortals,
Sometimes the only pay off for having any faith,
Is when it's tested again and again everyday,
I'm still comparing your past to my future,
It might be your wound but they're my sutures,
(Ooh)
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
(Ooh)
I try to picture me without you but I can't
